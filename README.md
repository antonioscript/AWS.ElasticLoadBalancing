# AWS.ElasticLoadBalancing
This repository showcases how to use AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to automatically distribute application traffic across multiple instances or containers, ensuring high availability, scalability, and resilience.

## Load Balancing

- Spread load across multiple downstream instances  
- Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application  
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances  
- Do regular health checks to your instances  
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites  
- Enforce stickiness with cookies  
- High availability across zones  
- Separate public traffic from private traffic
